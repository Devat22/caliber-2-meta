The Overall Batch Status on the QC form should be auto-calculated based on an aggregation of the smileys for each individual. Superstar should be 4, Good 3, Average 2, Poor 1--then we can average the score to get what the overall should be. This should be calculated on the back end, and the UI should be read-only and display what the back-end has calculated
